## Welcome

Welcome to _OWASP Penang Chapter_, a regional city chapter within [OWASP Kuala Lumpur](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-kuala-lumpur/). Our Chapter provides an opportunity for people on the northwest coast of Malaysia, specifically in Peninsular Malaysia, to discuss around and share iaround information and application security.

Anyone who is excited about and interested in application security is welcome. There are no costs to attend any meeting. **You don't need to be a member of OWASP**.

Referrals to this website or to individual meetings to colleagues or acquaintances are welcome.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert.
